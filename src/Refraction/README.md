# Refraction

Refraction is a disciplined, neo-blue, holographic instrument HUD that makes work feel fast, precise, and spatial: a single focused task lives in a primary glass pane while secondary context briefly orbits and disappears, with UI "materializing" and "dematerializing" from an emitter rather than navigating pages; it favors linework, glow, and negative space over heavy blocks, uses motion to explain intent (open/confirm/error/loading), stays input-agnostic and accessible (reticle focus, keyboard-first paths, reduced-motion), remains legible through transparency on noisy backgrounds, and treats OLED longevity as a first-class constraint—so the overall emotion is calm, technical immersion: minimal chrome, maximal clarity, and a sense of information being summoned exactly when needed, then fading back into the void.
