.SYNOPSIS
    Runs code-style cleanup (ReSharper CleanupCode) for both solutions in the repository.
.DESCRIPTION
    This is a convenience wrapper that sequentially invokes:
      â€¢ scripts/clean-up-mississippi-solution.ps1
      â€¢ scripts/clean-up-sample-solution.ps1
    It ensures both the core and sample solutions are formatted with the same rules.
