# RFC 2119 Usage

## Scope
Normative keywords in instruction files only.

## Definitions
MUST/SHALL: absolute requirement. MUST NOT: prohibition. SHOULD/RECOMMENDED: strong guidance, rare exceptions. MAY/OPTIONAL: truly optional.

## Rules
Uppercase only. One requirement per sentence. Include rationale. Anchor to artifacts. No conflicting keywords across files.

## Anti-Patterns
❌ Lowercase. ❌ Multiple requirements in one sentence. ❌ Missing rationale. ❌ Conflicts between files.

## Enforcement
PR reviews verify: uppercase, single requirements, rationales present, no conflicts.
