# RFC 2119 Keyword Usage for Instruction Authors

Governing thought: Keep normative text centralized and unambiguous.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- RFC keywords (`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `MAY`, and `SHALL/REQUIRED` variants) **MUST** be uppercase and used only for normative requirements; descriptive prose **SHOULD** avoid them.
- Each instruction file **MUST** include front matter with `applyTo`, an H1 title, governing thought, Drift check note, and a single consolidated **Rules** section near the top containing all normative statements. RFC keywords **SHOULD NOT** appear elsewhere except in quotes/examples.
- Each rule **MUST** scope its audience, contain one requirement per sentence, and include a brief “Why” when not obvious. Conflicting requirement levels across files **MUST NOT** exist.
- When exceptions are realistic, authors **SHOULD** choose `SHOULD/SHOULD NOT`; otherwise use `MUST/MUST NOT`.

## Quick Start

- Draft rules in the Rules section with scoped audience + Why lines; remove stray normative text elsewhere.
- Follow the authoring template for structure and `applyTo` metadata.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Front matter/H1/governing thought/Drift check present; `applyTo` set correctly.
- [ ] Rules centralized with uppercase keywords, scoped audiences, and Why lines.
- [ ] No conflicting requirement levels or stray normative statements.
