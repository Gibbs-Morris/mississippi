# RFC 2119 Keyword Usage for Instruction Authors

This document defines how to apply RFC 2119 normative keywords (`MUST`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`, etc.) inside every `*.instructions.md` file in this repository. Follow these rules so requirements are communicated unambiguously and consistently.

## At-a-Glance Quick-Start

- Use RFC 2119 keywords only when you intend to set a normative requirement; otherwise prefer plain descriptive prose.
- Write the keywords in uppercase (`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`, etc.) so they stand out to humans and automation.
- Clarify the “why” for every normative statement, mirroring the Instruction Authoring Guide.
- When you need an exception, document the precise conditions rather than weakening the requirement language.
- During reviews, scan new or updated instructions to ensure the chosen keyword matches the expectation’s strength.

## Why RFC 2119 Keywords Matter

- Provide a shared, legally precise vocabulary for requirements across all instruction files.
- Help downstream tooling (Copilot, Cursor, custom linters) parse what is mandatory versus optional.
- Prevent accidental weakening of repository policies when instructions are edited or summarized elsewhere.

## Canonical Keyword Meanings

| Keyword | Meaning in this repository |
| --- | --- |
| **MUST / REQUIRED / SHALL** | Absolute requirement; no deviation permitted. |
| **MUST NOT / SHALL NOT** | Absolute prohibition. |
| **SHOULD / RECOMMENDED** | Strong recommendation; there might be rare, well-documented exceptions. |
| **SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED** | Strong advice against something; exceptions must be justified explicitly. |
| **MAY / OPTIONAL** | Truly optional behavior; acceptable when omitted. |

> Treat `REQUIRED` and `SHALL` as synonyms for `MUST`, and `SHALL NOT` as a synonym for `MUST NOT`. Use the form that reads best in your sentence.

## Authoring Rules

1. **Define the expectation, then the rationale.** Follow each RFC 2119 statement with a short “why” sentence unless the context already makes it obvious.
2. **Anchor statements in real artifacts.** Mention the scripts, files, or workflows that enforce the rule so readers know where to look.
3. **One requirement per sentence.** Avoid chaining several `MUST` or `SHOULD` clauses together; split them into separate sentences or bullet points.
4. **Scope the audience.** Specify who the requirement applies to (e.g., “Agents MUST…”, “PowerShell scripts SHOULD…”). This prevents misinterpretation.
5. **Version references carefully.** If a requirement points to an external standard, cite the authoritative link so the meaning cannot drift.
6. **Prefer `SHOULD` over `MUST` only when exceptions are realistic.** If you do not already know what the exception looks like, default to `MUST`.
7. **Never mix conflicting keywords for the same behavior.** If an instruction says `MUST`, no other file may downgrade it to `SHOULD`. Resolve conflicts before merging.

## Example Patterns

```markdown
- Agents MUST run `pwsh ./go.ps1` before marking a fix complete.  
  Why: This script orchestrates every build/test gate and catches regressions.
- Test authors SHOULD add mutation tests when touching Mississippi projects.  
  Why: Mutation score enforces assertion quality without over-constraining Samples.
- Instruction updates MAY include diagrams when they clarify complex flows.
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Using lowercase (“must”, “should”)—automation may not recognize it as a normative keyword.
- ❌ Mixing multiple requirements in one long sentence (“Agents MUST…, SHOULD…, and MAY…”). Split them.
- ❌ Replacing a `MUST` with softer language because a single scenario is inconvenient. Instead, describe the approved exception explicitly.
- ❌ Adding RFC 2119 words to marketing or motivational text. Reserve them for actionable rules.
- ❌ Omitting rationale. Without context, reviewers cannot tell whether the keyword strength is justified.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Every `*.instructions.md` file uses uppercase RFC 2119 keywords for normative statements.
- [ ] The chosen keyword strength matches the enforcement level (MUST for enforced gates, SHOULD for strong guidance, MAY for optional steps).
- [ ] Each requirement names the relevant audience, artifact, or workflow.
- [ ] Exceptions are documented explicitly instead of weakening the keyword.
- [ ] No contradictory keywords exist for the same rule across instruction files; conflicts are resolved or deferred via a scratchpad task.
