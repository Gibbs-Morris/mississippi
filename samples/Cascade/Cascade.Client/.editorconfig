# CA1724: The Atomic Design folder structure (Atoms/Molecules/Organisms) with one component
# per folder is mandated by .github/instructions/blazor-ux-guidelines.instructions.md.
# Each component folder contains .razor, .razor.cs, styles, and tests following this pattern.
# This inherently creates namespace-type name conflicts that cannot be avoided without
# abandoning the established folder structure.
