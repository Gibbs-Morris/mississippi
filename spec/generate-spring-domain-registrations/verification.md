# Verification

## Claim List
1. Generators can emit AddSpringDomain wrappers for Spring client/server/silo without new public APIs.
2. Generated wrappers can include all required Spring registrations (aggregates, projections, sagas, mappers).
3. Manual SpringDomain*Registrations files can be deleted without changing Program.cs usage.
4. Generator scoping can limit output to Spring sample projects.
5. PendingSourceGenerator usage can be removed from Spring registrations once generated.

## Verification Questions
1. Where are the current SpringDomain*Registrations classes and which generated methods do they call?
2. Which generator projects are responsible for emitting the underlying Add* methods used by Spring today?
3. What options exist in the generator pipeline to scope output to specific projects (e.g., analyzer config, target root namespace)?
4. Are there existing patterns in generators for emitting cross-aggregate wrapper methods?
5. What namespaces do generated registrations land in for Spring client/server/silo?
6. Is PendingSourceGenerator required for generator discovery, or can it be removed safely once generated?
7. Do any other samples rely on AddSpringDomain-style wrappers that could be impacted by generator changes?
8. Are Spring program files already using AddSpringDomain in client/server/silo?

## Answers
1. Manual wrappers are in Spring.Client/Registrations, Spring.Server/Registrations, and Spring.Silo/Registrations; they call AddBankAccountAggregateFeature/AddMoneyTransferSagaFeature/AddProjectionsFeature (client), Add*AggregateMappers/Add*ProjectionMappers (server), and Add*Aggregate/Add*Projection/Add*Saga (silo). Evidence: [samples/Spring/Spring.Client/Registrations/SpringDomainClientRegistrations.cs](samples/Spring/Spring.Client/Registrations/SpringDomainClientRegistrations.cs), [samples/Spring/Spring.Server/Registrations/SpringDomainServerRegistrations.cs](samples/Spring/Spring.Server/Registrations/SpringDomainServerRegistrations.cs), [samples/Spring/Spring.Silo/Registrations/SpringDomainSiloRegistrations.cs](samples/Spring/Spring.Silo/Registrations/SpringDomainSiloRegistrations.cs).
2. Underlying Add* methods come from Inlet generators: client Add{Aggregate}Feature from CommandClientRegistrationGenerator and AddProjectionsFeature from ProjectionClientRegistrationGenerator; silo Add{Aggregate}Aggregate/Add{Projection}Projection/Add{Saga}Saga from AggregateSiloRegistrationGenerator/ProjectionSiloRegistrationGenerator/SagaSiloRegistrationGenerator; server Add{Aggregate}AggregateMappers and Add{Projection}ProjectionMappers from CommandServerDtoGenerator and ProjectionEndpointsGenerator. Evidence: [src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Client.Generators/ProjectionClientRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Client.Generators/ProjectionClientRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/AggregateSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/AggregateSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/ProjectionSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/ProjectionSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/SagaSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/SagaSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Server.Generators/CommandServerDtoGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Server.Generators/CommandServerDtoGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Server.Generators/ProjectionEndpointsGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Server.Generators/ProjectionEndpointsGenerator.cs).
3. Generators already use AnalyzerConfigOptionsProvider to resolve RootNamespace/AssemblyName and compute target root namespace; this can be used to gate Spring-only output by targetRootNamespace. Evidence: [src/Inlet.Generators.Core/Naming/TargetNamespaceResolver.cs](src/Inlet.Generators.Core/Naming/TargetNamespaceResolver.cs), [src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientDtoGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientDtoGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Client.Generators/SagaClientGeneratorHelper.cs](src/Inlet.Client.Generators/SagaClientGeneratorHelper.cs).
4. No existing generator emits cross-aggregate wrappers; current generators emit per-aggregate/per-projection/per-saga classes only. Evidence: [src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/AggregateSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Silo.Generators/AggregateSiloRegistrationGenerator.cs).
5. Client registration outputs use target root namespace (e.g., Spring.Client.Features for client features and Spring.Client.Features for projections); server mappers are in Spring.Server.Controllers.Aggregates.Mappers and Spring.Server.Controllers.Projections.Mappers; silo registrations are under Spring.Silo.Registrations. Evidence: [src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Client.Generators/CommandClientRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Client.Generators/ProjectionClientRegistrationGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Client.Generators/ProjectionClientRegistrationGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Server.Generators/CommandServerDtoGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Server.Generators/CommandServerDtoGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Server.Generators/ProjectionEndpointsGenerator.cs](src/Inlet.Server.Generators/ProjectionEndpointsGenerator.cs), [src/Inlet.Generators.Core/Naming/NamingConventions.cs](src/Inlet.Generators.Core/Naming/NamingConventions.cs).
6. PendingSourceGenerator is a marker for manual implementations intended for future generation and is not required for generator discovery; it can be removed once wrappers are generated. Evidence: [src/Inlet.Generators.Abstractions/PendingSourceGeneratorAttribute.cs](src/Inlet.Generators.Abstractions/PendingSourceGeneratorAttribute.cs).
7. No other sample AddSpringDomain-style wrappers were found; Crescent has a CounterRegistrations helper in tests only. Evidence: [samples/Crescent/Crescent.L2Tests/Domain/Counter/CounterRegistrations.cs](samples/Crescent/Crescent.L2Tests/Domain/Counter/CounterRegistrations.cs).
8. Spring programs already call AddSpringDomain in client/server/silo. Evidence: [samples/Spring/Spring.Client/Program.cs](samples/Spring/Spring.Client/Program.cs), [samples/Spring/Spring.Server/Program.cs](samples/Spring/Spring.Server/Program.cs), [samples/Spring/Spring.Silo/Program.cs](samples/Spring/Spring.Silo/Program.cs).
