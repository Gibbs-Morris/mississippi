# Improve SonarCloud Coverage to 80%

## Status: In Progress

## Task Size: Small

## Approval Checkpoint: No
No public API changes, no migrations, no breaking changes. Just test additions.

## Problem
SonarCloud quality gate failing: 74.3% coverage on new code vs 80% requirement.

## Goal
Add ~200 lines of coverage through targeted L0 tests on easy-to-test code.
