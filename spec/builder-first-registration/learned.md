# Learned

## Initial Orientation

- UNVERIFIED: Registration surfaces likely live under src/Reservoir/, src/Aqueduct/, src/Refraction/, src/EventSourcing.* and src/Inlet.*.
- UNVERIFIED: Builder patterns may be in existing Registrations classes or builder types; need inventory.
- UNVERIFIED: Docs to inspect under docs/Docusaurus/docs/ for Reservoir and Aqueduct registration guidance.
- UNVERIFIED: Tests to inspect under tests/ for registration usage and builder patterns.

## Verification Targets

- src/**/Registrations*.cs
- src/**/Builder*.cs
- src/**/IServiceCollection*.cs
- docs/Docusaurus/docs/**/reservoir*
- docs/Docusaurus/docs/**/aqueduct*
- tests/**
