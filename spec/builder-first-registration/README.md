Status: Draft

Task size: Large

Approval checkpoint: Yes (public registration APIs and builders will change across multiple packages)

## Summary

Define and enforce a builder-first registration model across Mississippi, Reservoir, and Aqueduct. Remove legacy registration entry points after builder-first replacements exist. Align options configuration on builder surfaces, and update docs/tests to teach and validate the model.
