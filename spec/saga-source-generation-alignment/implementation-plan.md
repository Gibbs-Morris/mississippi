# Implementation plan

## Initial outline
1. Inventory saga DTO/mapper/reducer patterns and aggregate/projection generator patterns.
2. Assess generic attribute support with repo target frameworks and language version.
3. Design saga source generation changes aligned to existing generator conventions.
4. Implement generator updates and migrate manual saga DTO/mapper/reducers.
5. Add/update tests and validation.
