# Implementation Plan

## Approach

Work topic-by-topic as directed by user. For each topic:

1. **Explore** - Read source code abstractions and implementations
2. **Understand** - Map interfaces, patterns, and relationships
3. **Find Examples** - Look in samples for usage patterns
4. **Write** - Create/expand documentation with diagrams and code
5. **Commit** - Commit the documentation update

## Topics Queue

Awaiting user direction on which topic to start with.

## Per-Topic Checklist

For each topic:
- [ ] Read abstraction interfaces
- [ ] Read implementation details
- [ ] Find sample usage
- [ ] Create/update doc file
- [ ] Add Mermaid diagrams
- [ ] Add code examples
- [ ] Link related concepts
- [ ] Commit changes

## Rollout

Documentation-only changes. No migrations or feature flags needed.

## Validation

- Markdown renders correctly
- Code examples are syntactically valid
- Links resolve correctly
- Diagrams render in Mermaid
