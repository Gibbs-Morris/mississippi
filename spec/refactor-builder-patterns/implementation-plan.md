# Implementation Plan

## Outline
1. Inventory all builder interfaces and extension methods.
2. Decide on the idiomatic replacement pattern (likely configure-lambda).
3. Update builder contracts and implementations.
4. Update registration extension methods and generators.
5. Update call sites in tests, samples, and docs.
6. Run build/tests and fix any breakages.
