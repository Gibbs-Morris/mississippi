# Implementation Plan

## Initial Outline
1. Inventory Docusaurus docs for legacy IServiceCollection registrations.
2. Update Reservoir, Store, Reducers, Effects, Feature State, DevTools, and Sagas docs to builder-first APIs.
3. Refresh links to the new builder extension methods/classes.
4. Verify no remaining legacy references.
5. Run markdown lint if required, then report changes.
