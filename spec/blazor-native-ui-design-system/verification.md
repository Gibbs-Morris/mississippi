# Verification

## Claim list (initial)

1. Docs can be added under docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction without breaking existing navigation.
2. A design system can be implemented in Blazor-native components without consumer JS.
3. Chart.js can be encapsulated behind strongly typed .NET models with no JS leakage.
4. Atomic design structure can be mirrored in docs and code.
5. The hologram design language can be expressed via tokens and CSS variables compatible with Blazor.
6. Mobile-first behavior can be defined for each component class.
7. Built-in themes (Neon Blue, Water Blue) can be provided without breaking existing theming.
8. Accessibility and keyboard navigation can be implemented consistently across components.
9. Documentation-first deliverables can be placed under docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction with required front matter.
10. Atomic design can be mirrored in the docs sidebar and component library structure.
11. Existing Refraction component content can be cleared without breaking required consumers (to be validated).

## Verification questions

1. What existing docs structure and sidebars exist under docs/Docusaurus, and where should refraction docs be placed to keep sidebar depth ≤2?
2. Are there existing design-system or UI component docs under docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction or related paths?
3. Which Blazor projects currently exist in src/ and what UI patterns, CSS conventions, or component base classes do they use?
4. Are there existing JS interop patterns for charts or visualization (Chart.js or others) that can be reused without leaking JS types?
5. What theming or CSS token approach is currently used (if any), and how can new tokens be introduced without breaking existing themes?
6. What testing patterns and frameworks are used for Blazor components in this repo (L0/L1/L2), and how are UI components currently tested?
7. What accessibility or keyboard navigation conventions are already enforced (e.g., ARIA patterns, focus ring styles)?
8. How are mobile/responsive behaviors handled in current UI assets (CSS breakpoints, responsive utilities, or layout components)?
9. Are there any existing build or lint rules specific to docs/Docusaurus that constrain content or structure?
10. Is there a preferred location or naming convention for new component libraries within src/ or tests/ that should be followed?
11. What consumers (if any) currently depend on Refraction components such that wiping them would break builds?

## Verification answers (evidence-based)

1. Docusaurus uses an autogenerated sidebar from docs structure (docs/Docusaurus/sidebars.ts). Current docs root is docs/Docusaurus/docs with top-level folders client-state-management and contributing plus index.md. A new docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction folder with a _category_.json will keep depth ≤2.
2. There is no docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction folder; no existing Refraction docs in the Docusaurus docs tree.
3. Refraction UI components exist in src/Refraction/Components with Atoms, Molecules, Organisms folders. Components use .razor, .razor.cs, and .razor.css files (e.g., Pane, TelemetryStrip). Tokens live in src/Refraction/Themes/RefractionTokens.css.
4. No evidence of existing JS interop patterns was found; repo-wide search for IJSRuntime/JSImport/IJSObjectReference in .cs/.razor returned no matches.
5. Existing theming uses CSS variables in RefractionTokens.css with raw and semantic tokens; new tokens should extend this model to avoid breaking existing usage.
6. Tests for Refraction exist as L0 tests in tests/Refraction.L0Tests and tests/Refraction.Pages.L0Tests and use bUnit (e.g., PaneTests, ReticleTests, SmokeConfirmTests). This indicates component tests are expected to use bUnit.
7. No explicit accessibility conventions were found in Refraction components beyond standard semantic markup; no repo-level ARIA conventions located yet (UNVERIFIED beyond inspected files).
8. No explicit responsive utilities were found in the inspected Refraction component CSS; media queries are not present in Pane/TelemetryStrip CSS (UNVERIFIED repo-wide).
9. Docs follow Docusaurus structure with front matter; docs/Docusaurus/README.md describes site build/test. Markdownlint rules apply repository-wide.
10. The Refraction library already uses atomic design folders; new component work should follow the existing src/Refraction/Components/{Atoms,Molecules,Organisms} structure and L0 tests under tests/Refraction.*.L0Tests.
11. UNVERIFIED: Downstream consumers of Refraction components have not been validated. Requires solution build or reference scan before removing content.
