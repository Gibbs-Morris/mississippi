# Implementation Plan (Initial)

## Outline

1. Verify repository structure, existing UI components, and docs patterns.
2. Research required external sources and compile citations.
3. Produce document-first deliverables (design language spec, tokens/theming spec, component inventory, reference examples).
4. Define the component architecture and project placement.
5. Implement core tokens, themes, and signature components.
6. Implement data-centric components and Chart.js integration.
7. Add tests, docs pages, and examples for each component.
8. Run build/test/cleanup scripts and address issues.
