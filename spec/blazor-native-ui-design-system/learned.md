# Learned

## Repository orientation

- UNVERIFIED: Docs live under docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction.
- UNVERIFIED: Existing UI/component patterns for Refraction live under src/Refraction or related Blazor projects.

## Requirements captured (from user request)

- Authoritative hologram design language brief governs tokens, visual language, motion, layering, and signature components.
- Blazor-native components with state down / events up contract.
- Mobile-first with explicit mobile modes for dense components.
- Enterprise quality: accessibility, keyboard navigation, performance (virtualization), i18n readiness, testability, theming, docs.
- Documentation-first deliverables in docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction.
- Atomic design structure across docs and code.
- Mandatory Chart.js integration via Blazor-first components with strongly typed .NET models.
- Built-in themes: Neon Blue (dark), Water Blue (light + dark), yin/yang approach across light/dark.

## Sources to verify

- README.md for repo conventions and entry points.
- docs/Docusaurus sidebar structure.
- Existing Blazor projects in src/ for patterns.
- Existing charting or JS interop patterns for guidance.

## Assumptions (UNVERIFIED)

- docs/Docusaurus uses standard Docusaurus sidebars.json or equivalent.
- There is no current design system under docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction.
