# Learned

## Repository orientation

- Docs live under docs/Docusaurus/docs with an autogenerated sidebar (docs/Docusaurus/sidebars.ts).
- There is no docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction folder yet; existing doc sections include client-state-management and contributing.
- Refraction UI components already exist under src/Refraction/Components with Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms folders.
- Refraction tokens exist at src/Refraction/Themes/RefractionTokens.css using CSS variables.
- Docusaurus docs use front matter (e.g., docs/Docusaurus/docs/index.md).

## Requirements captured (from user request)

- Authoritative hologram design language brief governs tokens, visual language, motion, layering, and signature components.
- Blazor-native components with state down / events up contract.
- Mobile-first with explicit mobile modes for dense components.
- Enterprise quality: accessibility, keyboard navigation, performance (virtualization), i18n readiness, testability, theming, docs.
- Documentation-first deliverables in docs/Docusaurus/docs/refraction.
- Atomic design structure across docs and code.
- Mandatory Chart.js integration via Blazor-first components with strongly typed .NET models.
- Built-in themes: Neon Blue (dark), Water Blue (light + dark), yin/yang approach across light/dark.

## Sources to verify

- README.md for repo conventions and entry points.
- docs/Docusaurus sidebar structure.
- Existing Blazor projects in src/ for patterns.
- Existing charting or JS interop patterns for guidance.

## Evidence

- Autogenerated sidebar: docs/Docusaurus/sidebars.ts
- Docs root and structure: docs/Docusaurus/docs/index.md, docs/Docusaurus/docs/client-state-management/_category_.json
- Refraction component structure: src/Refraction/Components/Atoms, Molecules, Organisms
- Refraction tokens: src/Refraction/Themes/RefractionTokens.css
- Refraction component tests use bUnit: tests/Refraction.L0Tests/Components/** (PaneTests, ReticleTests, SmokeConfirmTests)

## Assumptions (UNVERIFIED)

- Chart.js or other JS interop is not currently used; no evidence found yet.

## Evidence notes

- Repo-wide search for IJSRuntime/JSImport/IJSObjectReference returned no matches in code files.
