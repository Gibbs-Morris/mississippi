# C# Naming and XML Documentation

Governing thought: Use feature-centric namespaces, clear PascalCase identifiers, and factual XML docs enforced by StyleCop.

> Drift check: StyleCop/analysis settings live in `Directory.Build.props` and `.editorconfig`; review them before editing.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Naming/StyleCop rules (SA13xx/SA16xx) **MUST** be treated as build-breaking; violations **MUST** be fixed, not suppressed. Why: Keeps naming/docs consistent.
- Namespaces **MUST** be feature-oriented (no `Services/Models` silos), max five PascalCase segments, no underscores; abbreviations **MUST** be industry-standard only. Why: Improves discoverability.
- Types **MUST** use PascalCase nouns; interfaces **MUST** prefix `I`; enums **MUST** be singular with PascalCase members. Why: Aligns with .NET guidelines.
- Methods **MUST** use PascalCase verb phrases; properties **MUST** be PascalCase nouns; booleans **MUST** start with `Is/Has/Can/Should`; DI properties **MUST** follow `private Type Name { get; }`; private fields/locals **MUST** be camelCase with no underscore; constants **MUST** be PascalCase. Why: Keeps identifiers unambiguous.
- Public (and internal when exposed) symbols **MUST** have XML docs with `<summary>` (imperative voice), `<param>`/`<typeparam>`/`<returns>` as applicable; text **MUST** be factual (no TODOs) and `<example>` snippets **MUST** compile. Why: Ensures IntelliSense and docs quality.
- Abstract base classes **SHOULD NOT** use "Base" unless intended for inheritance; Orleans abstract grains ending in "Base" **MAY** follow Orleans guidance. Why: Avoids noisy suffixes unless necessary.
- Documentation for private/internal members **SHOULD** exist only when behavior is non-trivial or exposed via `InternalsVisibleTo`. Why: Balances value vs noise.

## Scope and Audience

All C# contributors.

## At-a-Glance Quick-Start

- Derive namespaces from company/product/feature; keep <=5 segments.
- Use PascalCase nouns for types/properties/constants; `I`-prefixed interfaces; camelCase locals/fields without underscores.
- Prefix booleans with `Is/Has/Can/Should`; keep DI properties as get-only.
- Write concise, factual XML docs for public APIs; validate tags match parameters.

## Core Principles

- Feature-first organization improves discovery.
- Consistent naming reduces StyleCop churn and reviewer overhead.
- Documentation should explain intent and usage without speculation.

## Domain Type Suffixes (Event Sourcing)

| Type | Suffix | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Aggregate state | `Aggregate` | `ChannelAggregate` |
| Command handler | `Handler` | `CreateChannelHandler` |
| Aggregate reducer | `Reducer` | `ChannelCreatedReducer` |
| Projection state | `Projection` | `UserProfileProjection` |
| Projection reducer | `ProjectionReducer` | `UserRegisteredProjectionReducer` |
| Registration class | `Registrations` | `CascadeRegistrations` |
| LoggerExtensions | `LoggerExtensions` | `BrookWriterGrainLoggerExtensions` |
