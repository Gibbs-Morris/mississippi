# Orleans Serialization Best Practices

Governing thought: Apply explicit Orleans serialization using `[GenerateSerializer]`, `[Id]`, and `[Alias]` attributes with progressive versioning to ensure type safety, version tolerance, and deployment compatibility.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- All serializable types **MUST** use explicit serialization with `[GenerateSerializer]` and `[Id]` attributes.  
  Why: Orleans requires explicit marking for version tolerance and avoids implicit serialization issues.
- Developers **MUST NOT** rely on implicit serialization.  
  Why: Explicit serialization ensures version tolerance and prevents breaking changes during deployments.
- All serializable types **MUST** use `[Alias]` attributes for type and method stability.  
  Why: Enables renames and refactoring without breaking serialization compatibility.
- Member IDs **MUST** start at zero for each type in the inheritance hierarchy.  
  Why: Maintains consistent numbering scheme and prevents ID conflicts.
- Developers **MUST** follow progressive versioning and maintain backward compatibility when evolving types.  
  Why: Ensures rolling deployments work correctly without serialization errors.
- Projects **MUST** reference `Microsoft.Orleans.Sdk` and `Microsoft.Orleans.CodeGenerator.MSBuild` packages.  
  Why: Enables Orleans source generation and build-time serializer creation.
- All serializable members **MUST** have unique `[Id(n)]` attributes within their inheritance level.  
  Why: Prevents serialization conflicts and ensures deterministic member ordering.
- All serializable types **MUST** have `[Alias]` attributes with globally unique names.  
  Why: Prevents naming conflicts across assemblies and deployments.
- Developers **MUST NOT** change existing member IDs.  
  Why: Changing IDs breaks serialization compatibility with existing deployments.
- Developers **MUST NOT** perform breaking type conversions like converting between `record` and `class`.  
  Why: Maintains serialization format compatibility across versions.
- New members **MUST** use previously unused ID numbers.  
  Why: Preserves existing serialization format and enables additive versioning.
- Build pipelines **MUST** enable Orleans analyzers with `--warnaserror` to fail builds on violations.  
  Why: Catches serialization issues at build time before deployment.
- Reviewers **SHOULD** verify version compatibility when reviewing Orleans serialization changes.  
  Why: Prevents deployment issues from serialization incompatibilities.
- Developers **SHOULD** mark removed members with `[NonSerialized]` or `[Obsolete]` instead of deleting immediately.  
  Why: Allows gradual deprecation without breaking existing serialized data.
- Developers **SHOULD** widen numeric types (e.g., `int` → `long`) when type changes are needed.  
  Why: Widening is safe for serialization compatibility; other changes may break.
- Developers **SHOULD** make non-nullable properties nullable when adding optionality.  
  Why: Safe versioning operation that doesn't break existing serialized data.
- For analyzer violations or missing attributes, agents **SHOULD** open focused `.scratchpad/tasks/pending` items to schedule remediation.  
  Why: Tracks technical debt systematically without blocking immediate work.

## Scope and Audience

**Audience:** Developers creating or modifying Orleans serializable types in the Mississippi Framework.

**In scope:** Serialization attributes, versioning guidelines, analyzer rules, build-time code generation, breaking vs. safe changes.

**Out of scope:** General Orleans grain development (see orleans.instructions.md), Orleans cluster configuration.

## Purpose

This document defines Orleans serialization standards ensuring version tolerance, performance, and compatibility across deployments through explicit attribute-based serialization.

## Core Principles

- Always use explicit serialization with required attributes
- Never rely on implicit serialization
- Use aliases for type stability across renames
- Start member IDs at zero per inheritance level
- Follow progressive versioning for backward compatibility
- Enable build-time code generation with MSBuild packages

## Quick-Start Checklist

### Required Package References

```xml
<!-- Core Orleans packages with serialization support -->
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Orleans.Sdk" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Orleans.CodeGenerator.MSBuild" />
```

### Basic Attribute Usage

```csharp
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("MyCompany.MyProduct.MyType")]
public class CustomerData
{
    [Id(0)] public string Name { get; set; }
    [Id(1)] public string Email { get; set; }
    [Id(2)] public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
}
```

## Orleans Serialization Attributes Reference

| Attribute | Purpose | Scope | Required | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| `[GenerateSerializer]` | Marks type for code generation | Class, Record, Struct | Yes | MUST be on every serializable type |
| `[Id(n)]` | Assigns unique member identifier | Property, Field | Yes | Start from 0, unique per inheritance level |
| `[Alias("name")]` | Provides stable type/method name | Class, Interface, Method | Recommended | Enables renames without breaking compatibility |
| `[NonSerialized]` | Excludes member from serialization | Property, Field | Optional | Use for computed or transient properties |

## Worked Example: HeadStorageModel

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Storage model for brook head position information.
/// Demonstrates proper Orleans serialization attribute usage.
/// </summary>
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("Mississippi.EventSourcing.Cosmos.Storage.HeadStorageModel")]
internal class HeadStorageModel
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the current position of the brook head.
    /// </summary>
    [Id(0)]
    public BrookPosition Position { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the original position of the brook head before any updates.
    /// Note: Nullable types are fully supported in Orleans serialization.
    /// </summary>
    [Id(1)]
    public BrookPosition? OriginalPosition { get; set; }
}
```

### Key Points from Example

1. **`[GenerateSerializer]`** tells Orleans to generate serialization code
2. **`[Alias]`** provides a stable name independent of namespace/class renames
3. **`[Id(0)]` and `[Id(1)]`** assign unique identifiers starting from zero
4. **Nullable types** are fully supported without special handling
5. **XML documentation** follows the project's naming conventions

## Versioning Guidelines

| Scenario | ✅ Safe Operations | ❌ Breaking Changes |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Adding Members** | Add new properties with unused ID numbers | Change existing member IDs |
| **Removing Members** | Mark with `[NonSerialized]` or `[Obsolete]` | Delete properties immediately |
| **Type Changes** | Widen numeric types (`int` → `long`) | Change signedness (`int` → `uint`) |
| **Inheritance** | Add new subclasses | Insert new base classes |
| **Nullability** | Make non-nullable properties nullable | Make nullable properties non-nullable |
| **Records vs Classes** | Add members to existing type | Convert between `record` and `class` |

### Version Evolution Example

```csharp
// Version 1.0
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("MyApp.Customer")]
public class Customer
{
    [Id(0)] public string Name { get; set; }
    [Id(1)] public string Email { get; set; }
}

// Version 2.0 - Safe additions
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("MyApp.Customer")]
public class Customer
{
    [Id(0)] public string Name { get; set; }
    [Id(1)] public string Email { get; set; }
    [Id(2)] public DateTime? CreatedAt { get; set; }     // New nullable field
    [Id(3)] public string? PhoneNumber { get; set; }    // New optional field
}
```

## Special Cases and Advanced Patterns

### Record Types

```csharp
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("MyApp.OrderEvent")]
public record OrderCreated(
    [property: Id(0)] string OrderId,
    [property: Id(1)] decimal Amount,
    [property: Id(2)] DateTime Timestamp)
{
    // Body members don't clash with primary constructor IDs
    [Id(0)] public string? Notes { get; init; }
}
```

### Inheritance Hierarchies

```csharp
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("MyApp.Publication")]
public class Publication
{
    [Id(0)] public string Title { get; set; }
    [Id(1)] public DateTime PublishedDate { get; set; }
}

[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("MyApp.Book")]
public class Book : Publication
{
    // IDs restart at 0 for each inheritance level
    [Id(0)] public string ISBN { get; set; }
    [Id(1)] public int PageCount { get; set; }
}
```

### Surrogate Patterns for External Types

```csharp
// For types you cannot modify
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("MyApp.UriSurrogate")]
public struct UriSurrogate
{
    [Id(0)] public string Value { get; set; }
    
    public static implicit operator Uri(UriSurrogate surrogate) => new(surrogate.Value);
    public static implicit operator UriSurrogate(Uri uri) => new() { Value = uri.ToString() };
}
```

## Common Build-Time Analyzers

| Analyzer ID | Severity | Trigger | Solution |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|
| `ORLEANS0004` | Error | Missing `[Id]` attributes on serializable members | Add `[Id(n)]` to all properties/fields |
| `ORLEANS0005` | Info | `[Serializable]` without `[GenerateSerializer]` | Replace with `[GenerateSerializer]` |
| `ORLEANS0011` | Error | Duplicate `[Alias]` values | Ensure all aliases are globally unique |
| `ORLEANS0012` | Error | Duplicate `[Id]` values within type | Assign unique ID numbers per inheritance level |

### Fixing Common Analyzer Issues

```csharp
// ORLEANS0004: Add missing [Id] attributes
[GenerateSerializer]
public class BadExample
{
    public string Name { get; set; }        // ❌ Missing [Id]
    public string Email { get; set; }       // ❌ Missing [Id]
}

[GenerateSerializer]
public class GoodExample
{
    [Id(0)] public string Name { get; set; }    // ✅ Has [Id]
    [Id(1)] public string Email { get; set; }   // ✅ Has [Id]
}

// ORLEANS0011: Fix duplicate aliases
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("Customer")]        // ❌ Duplicate alias
public class CustomerV1 { }

[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("Customer")]        // ❌ Same alias as above
public class CustomerV2 { }

// Fixed version
[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("Customer.V1")]     // ✅ Unique alias
public class CustomerV1 { }

[GenerateSerializer]
[Alias("Customer.V2")]     // ✅ Unique alias
public class CustomerV2 { }
```

## Pull Request Safety Checklist

When reviewing Orleans serialization changes, verify:

- [ ] All serializable types have `[GenerateSerializer]` attribute
- [ ] All serializable members have unique `[Id(n)]` attributes within their inheritance level
- [ ] All types have `[Alias]` attributes with globally unique names
- [ ] New members use previously unused ID numbers
- [ ] No existing member IDs were changed
- [ ] No breaking type conversions (e.g., `record` ↔ `class`)
- [ ] Build succeeds without ORLEANS analyzer warnings
- [ ] Version compatibility maintained for rolling deployments
- [ ] XML documentation follows project naming conventions
- [ ] For any analyzer violations or missing attributes discovered, open focused `.scratchpad/tasks/pending` items per type to schedule remediation if not fixed immediately (see Agent Scratchpad)

## Enforcement

These serialization standards should be enforced through:

1. **Build Pipeline**: Orleans analyzers enabled with `--warnaserror` to fail builds on violations
2. **Code Reviews**: All serialization changes must be reviewed for version compatibility
3. **Static Analysis**: ORLEANS0004, ORLEANS0005, ORLEANS0011, ORLEANS0012 treated as build errors
4. **Testing**: Serialization round-trip tests for all new serializable types
5. **Documentation**: Keep these guidelines updated with new patterns and examples
