# Mutation Testing Playbook

Governing thought: Run Stryker on clean builds and close survivors through targeted tests.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- `dotnet tool restore` **MUST** be run before mutation testing, and a clean build **MUST** precede any Stryker run.
- Mutation scripts **MUST** be allowed to finish (plan for ~30 minutes); generated report paths **MUST** be committed for traceability.
- Production code **MUST NOT** be changed solely to kill mutants unless they are provably unkillable via tests; warnings/test failures **MUST** be fixed before mutation work.
- Survivors **SHOULD** be prioritized with the summarizer; use `-SkipMutationRun` for iterative analysis; survivor tasks auto-sync to `.scratchpad/tasks` and **SHOULD** guide the work.
- Repository-wide guidance remains authoritative; keep instruction Markdown and `.mdc` in sync via `sync-instructions-to-mdc.ps1` when changed.

## Quick Start

1) Prep tools and build:
```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "dotnet tool restore"
pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/build-mississippi-solution.ps1
```
2) Run mutation tests:
```powershell
pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/mutation-test-mississippi-solution.ps1
```
3) Summarize/prioritize survivors (rerun Stryker unless skipped):
```powershell
pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/summarize-mutation-survivors.ps1 -SkipMutationRun -Top 5 -GenerateTasks
```

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Tool restore + clean build completed; mutation run not cancelled.
- [ ] Reports committed; survivors prioritized via summarizer/tasks.
- [ ] Tests, not production hacks, used to kill mutants unless truly unkillable.
- [ ] Instruction/`.mdc` parity maintained if edits were made.
