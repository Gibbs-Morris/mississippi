# Pull Request Review Coaching Guide

Governing thought: Deliver high-signal reviews that protect architecture, testing depth, and focused scope.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Reviews **MUST** pause when diffs exceed ~600 changed lines; coach authors to split before continuing.
- Reviews **MUST** fail when new behavior lacks L0 tests; verify authors ran `pwsh ./go.ps1` or targeted scripts before approval.
- PRs **MUST** hold one change narrative (single responsibility); mixed concerns **MUST** be split. Size/mixed edits **SHOULD** trigger a split request with a suggested plan.
- Feedback **SHOULD** be actionable and balanced; reinforce good patterns while calling out issues directly.

## Quick Start

- Read description/linked work and ensure scope is singular (feature/fix/maintenance).
- If oversized, request a split; then review architecture (SOLID, DI/property pattern, logging/service-registration alignment) and tests (L0 required; deeper levels per `testing.instructions.md`; mutation expectations per `mutation-testing.instructions.md`).
- Require evidence of recent script runs (`go.ps1` or targeted build/test/mutation scripts).

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Scope is single-purpose; size reasonable (<~600 lines) or split requested.
- [ ] L0 tests present for behavior changes; additional levels used appropriately; mutation expectations handled.
- [ ] Build/test scripts run (`go.ps1` or targeted equivalents).
- [ ] Architecture respects SOLID, DI property pattern, logging/service-registration rules.
- [ ] Feedback delivered with clear actions and acknowledgments of strengths.
