# RFC 2119 Keyword Usage

Governing thought: Use RFC 2119 keywords only for normative requirements, keep them uppercase, and confine them to a single Rules section per file.

> Drift check: Treat referenced scripts/configs as canonical; open them before quoting commands or behavior.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- RFC keywords (`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `MAY`, `REQUIRED`, `SHALL`, `SHALL NOT`) **MUST** appear only for normative requirements and **MUST** be uppercase. Why: Keeps intent unambiguous.
- Each instruction **MUST** contain one consolidated **Rules (RFC 2119)** section near the top; keywords **SHOULD NOT** appear elsewhere except in quoted examples. Why: Simplifies parsing.
- Each rule bullet **MUST** contain a single requirement and **MUST** include a short rationale when not obvious. Why: Avoids chained/conflicting rules.
- Instruction files **MUST** include front matter with `applyTo`, an H1 title, governing thought, and a Drift check note. Why: Aligns with the template.
- Audience/scope **MUST** be explicit; conflicting requirement levels across files **MUST NOT** persist—authors **MUST** resolve them before merging. Why: Prevents policy drift.
- When exceptions are realistic, authors **SHOULD** use `SHOULD`/`SHOULD NOT` instead of weakening a `MUST`; scope **MUST** be clear (e.g., “Agents”). Why: Matches enforcement strength to reality.

## Scope and Audience

Instruction authors and reviewers (including Copilot/Cursor rule authors).

## At-a-Glance Quick-Start

- Put all keywords in one Rules section; keep them uppercase and one requirement per bullet.
- Add rationale lines; state audience/scope.
- Resolve cross-file conflicts before merge.

## Core Principles

- Consistent keyword usage enables automation and human reviewers to read rules quickly.
- Clear scope and rationale prevent misapplication.
