# Markdown Authoring and Lint Compliance

Governing thought: Every Markdown file must pass markdownlint without suppressions.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Markdown **MUST** comply with active markdownlint rules (MD001–MD059; MD013 already disabled in repo config); warnings **MUST** block submission. Suppressions/config overrides **MUST NOT** be added unless a task explicitly directs a one-off exception.
- Authors **MUST** follow GitHub Flavored Markdown, run markdownlint locally, and fix findings before committing.
- Content **SHOULD** use plain Markdown over HTML, with accessible headings, descriptive links, and alt text. Link targets **MUST** resolve; use stable URLs when possible.

## Quick Start

- Validate with `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` (repo configs: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`, `.github/linters/.markdown-lint.yml`).
- Keep structure clear: single top-level heading, blank lines around blocks/lists, fenced code with languages, meaningful link text and alt text.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] markdownlint clean with no new suppressions.
- [ ] GFM-compatible structure and accessibility (headings, links, alt text).
- [ ] Stable/working links; plain Markdown preferred over HTML.
