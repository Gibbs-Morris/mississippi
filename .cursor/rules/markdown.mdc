# Markdown Authoring and Lint Compliance

Governing thought: All Markdown files comply with `markdownlint` rules without exceptions or suppressions; agents fix issues at the source rather than disabling rules.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Agents **MUST** author, review, and maintain Markdown so that it passes the canonical set of `markdownlint` rules without exceptions.  
  Why: Ensures consistent, high-quality documentation across the repository.
- Agents **MUST** treat `markdownlint` warnings as build blockers and fix the source rather than disabling or suppressing rules.  
  Why: Maintains documentation quality and prevents accumulation of technical debt.
- Agents **MUST NOT** disable, suppress, or reconfigure `markdownlint` rules (including via `markdownlint-disable` comments, config overrides, or ignore lists) unless the current user task explicitly instructs otherwise for a single case.  
  Why: Prevents erosion of documentation standards through ad-hoc exceptions.
- Agents **MUST** follow GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) semantics and ensure rendered output matches intent on GitHub.  
  Why: Documentation is consumed primarily on GitHub; rendering must be correct.
- Agents **MUST** follow all active markdownlint rules (MD001-MD059).  
  Why: Rules enforce best practices for readability, accessibility, and consistency.
- Agents **MUST** run `markdownlint` locally and resolve all reported issues before submitting changes.  
  Why: Catches issues early and prevents failed CI builds.
- Agents **SHOULD** prefer plain Markdown over inline HTML.  
  Why: Plain Markdown is more maintainable and portable across renderers.
- Agents **SHOULD** keep authored content accessible by using descriptive link text, semantic headings, and alt text on images.  
  Why: Improves accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Scope and Audience

**Audience:** All contributors authoring or reviewing Markdown files in the repository.

**In scope:** Markdown authoring standards, markdownlint compliance, formatting rules.

**Out of scope:** General writing style, content strategy, documentation architecture.

## Purpose

This instruction ensures every Markdown file in the repository passes `markdownlint` validation, maintaining consistent, accessible, high-quality documentation.

## Core Principles

- Fix at source: address linting issues by improving the Markdown, not by suppressing rules
- GFM compatibility: ensure correct rendering on GitHub
- Accessibility first: descriptive links, semantic headings, image alt text
- Plain Markdown preferred: avoid HTML unless necessary

## Configuration

The repository uses markdownlint configuration files:

- **Local development**: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` (auto-discovered by markdownlint-cli2)
- **CI/Super-Linter**: `.github/linters/.markdown-lint.yml` (used by GitHub Super-Linter)

Both files disable only:

- **MD013** (line length) - Technical documentation often requires longer lines for code examples, URLs, command lines, and tables

All other markdownlint rules remain active.

## Authoring Checklist

1. Structure the document with a single top-level heading and incremental subheadings.
2. Break paragraphs and lists with required blank lines; avoid trailing whitespace everywhere else.
3. Keep lists, tables, code fences, emphasis, and links stylistically consistent across the file.
4. Provide alt text for every image and use meaningful link text instead of generic phrases.
5. Run `markdownlint` locally (for example: `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` from the repo root) before
   submitting changes and resolve *all* reported issues.

## markdownlint Rules Reference

The following rules are enforced exactly as documented by `markdownlint`.

- **MD001 – Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time.**
- **MD002 – First heading should be the top-level heading.**
- **MD003 – Use a consistent heading style (ATX or setext).**
- **MD004 – Use a consistent unordered list marker style.**
- **MD005 – Indent list items at the same level consistently.**
- **MD006 – Use consistent indentation for nested lists.**
- **MD007 – Indent unordered list children by the configured number of spaces (default 2).**
- **MD009 – Remove trailing spaces except where a hard line break is intended.**
- **MD010 – Do not use hard tab characters; replace them with spaces.**
- **MD011 – Use proper link order like `[label](https://example.com/)`; avoid `(label)[https://example.com/]`.**
- **MD012 – Avoid multiple consecutive blank lines (default maximum is one).**
- **MD013 – Keep line length within the configured limit (default 80) unless the rule allows otherwise.**
- **MD014 – Omit leading `$` prompts from shell command examples unless output is shown.**
- **MD018 – Insert exactly one space after the hash in ATX headings.**
- **MD019 – Do not use multiple spaces after the hash in ATX headings.**
- **MD020 – Add a space between hashes and text for closed ATX headings.**
- **MD021 – Avoid multiple spaces inside the hashes of closed ATX headings.**
- **MD022 – Surround every heading with the required blank lines.**
- **MD023 – Start headings at the beginning of the line (no leading indentation).**
- **MD024 – Prevent duplicate headings (respect configured sibling-only behavior when applicable).**
- **MD025 – Use a single top-level heading unless front matter supplies the title.**
- **MD026 – Do not end headings with disallowed punctuation.**
- **MD027 – Use a single space after the blockquote marker (`>`).**
- **MD028 – Do not leave blank lines inside blockquotes unless they are part of the quote.**
- **MD029 – Choose an ordered list numbering style (`1.` or sequential) and stay consistent.**
- **MD030 – Ensure the correct number of spaces after ordered and unordered list markers.**
- **MD031 – Surround fenced code blocks with blank lines (respect list exceptions only when configured).**
- **MD032 – Surround lists with blank lines.**
- **MD033 – Avoid inline HTML unless it is explicitly permitted by configuration.**
- **MD034 – Wrap bare URLs and email addresses in angle brackets.**
- **MD035 – Use a consistent horizontal rule style.**
- **MD036 – Do not use emphasis in place of headings.**
- **MD037 – Avoid spaces inside emphasis markers.**
- **MD038 – Avoid spaces inside code span backticks.**
- **MD039 – Avoid spaces inside link text brackets.**
- **MD040 – Specify a language for every fenced code block (use `text` when highlighting is unnecessary).**
- **MD041 – Start the file with a top-level heading unless front matter declares the title.**
- **MD042 – Do not create empty links; provide a valid destination.**
- **MD043 – Match required heading structures when the rule is configured.**
- **MD044 – Use correct capitalization for proper names per the configured list.**
- **MD045 – Supply alt text for every image (or mark decorative images with `aria-hidden="true"`).**
- **MD046 – Use a consistent code block style (fenced or indented) within the file.**
- **MD047 – End each file with exactly one newline character.**
- **MD048 – Use a consistent code fence marker (backticks or tildes).**
- **MD049 – Use a consistent emphasis marker style (`*` or `_`).**
- **MD050 – Use a consistent strong emphasis marker style (`**` or `__`).**
- **MD051 – Ensure link fragments map to valid generated anchors or explicit IDs.**
- **MD052 – Reference links and images must use labels that are defined.**
- **MD053 – Define reference links and images only when they are used (remove unused or duplicate definitions).**
- **MD054 – Use only the allowed link and image styles per configuration (autolink, inline, reference).**
- **MD055 – Keep table rows consistent with the configured presence of leading/trailing pipes.**
- **MD056 – Ensure every table row has the same number of columns.**
- **MD058 – Surround tables with blank lines.**
- **MD059 – Write descriptive link text; avoid generic phrases like “click here”.**

> **Note:** The repository configuration files (`.markdownlint.yaml` and `.github/linters/.markdown-lint.yml`)
> disable MD013 (line length) only. All other markdownlint rules are active and enforced.

## Quality Enforcement

- Run `npx markdownlint-cli2 --fix "**/*.md"` only when you have reviewed the proposed edits; manual fixes
  are preferred so the author remains in control of content.
- Submit Markdown changes only after linting passes with zero errors and warnings.
- Do not add blanket suppressions, global `markdownlint-disable` directives, or inline overrides unless the
  current user task explicitly directs that specific exception and you document the instruction in context.
