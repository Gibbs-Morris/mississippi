# Instruction Authoring Guide

Governing thought: Write instruction files in the standard template with concise, centralized rules.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Files **MUST** live in `.github/instructions/`, use kebab-case `<topic>.instructions.md`, start with YAML `applyTo`, an H1 title, a governing thought, and a brief Drift check reminding readers that scripts are authoritative.
- All normative statements **MUST** appear in a single **Rules (RFC 2119)** section near the top; rules **MUST** use uppercase RFC keywords with one requirement per sentence and a short “Why” when not obvious. RFC keywords **SHOULD NOT** appear elsewhere except in quoted examples.
- Documents **MUST** follow the Minto order (answer → reasons → evidence) and the standard section template; examples and long evidence **MUST** appear later. Each rule bullet **MUST** include at least one RFC keyword.
- Content **SHOULD** stay concise and token-efficient; sentences short/active; headings not skipped (H2/H3/H4). Provide At-a-Glance quick-starts when helpful. Use US English; links **MUST** resolve and be relative; external links **SHOULD** be stable.
- Command examples **MUST** reference real, reviewed scripts; include cleanup when side effects exist and list prerequisites when necessary.

## Quick Start

- Copy the standard template, set `applyTo`, H1, governing thought, and Rules near the top; move examples near the end.
- Keep instruction Markdown canonical and sync `.mdc` via `pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/sync-instructions-to-mdc.ps1` per the Instruction ↔ Cursor policy.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Front matter, H1, governing thought, and Drift check present; file named/located correctly.
- [ ] Rules centralized with RFC keywords and Why lines; no stray normative text elsewhere.
- [ ] Structure follows the template with concise prose and validated links.
- [ ] Examples/scripts are accurate with prerequisites/cleanup noted.
