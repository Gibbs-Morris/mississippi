# Documentation Page Focus

# Documentation Page Focus

Governing thought: Every documentation page serves one audience with one purpose—mixing public API guidance with internal implementation details creates confusion.

> Drift check: This file defines page focus rules for `docs/Docusaurus/`; update as documentation patterns evolve.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Each page **MUST** declare its focus in the Overview section as either **Public API / Developer Experience** or **Internal Implementation**. Why: Readers must know immediately whether the page helps them build on the framework or understand its internals.
- **Public API / Developer Experience** pages **MUST** focus on contracts, usage patterns, configuration, and outcomes a developer building on Mississippi will encounter. They **MUST NOT** explain implementation internals beyond what is necessary to use the API correctly. Why: DX-focused readers need actionable guidance, not source-code walkthroughs.
- **Internal Implementation** pages **MUST** focus on how the framework works under the hood, architectural decisions, performance characteristics, and extension points. They **SHOULD** assume the reader already understands the public API. Why: Implementation-focused readers need depth, not introductory usage examples.
- Pages **MUST NOT** mix both concerns; if a topic requires both, authors **MUST** split into separate pages and cross-link them. Why: Mixed pages force readers to skip irrelevant sections and obscure the page's purpose.
- The page's focus **SHOULD** be reflected in its location within the sidebar hierarchy (e.g., `internals/` vs feature folders). Why: Consistent placement aids discoverability.

## Scope and Audience

All contributors writing or updating documentation in `docs/Docusaurus/`.

## At-a-Glance Quick-Start

- Decide before writing: Is this page for someone **using** the feature or someone **understanding** how it works internally?
- State the focus explicitly in the Overview section.
- Keep content aligned with the declared focus; split if needed.
- Place pages in the appropriate sidebar section.

## Focus Types

### Public API / Developer Experience

These pages answer: *How do I use this?*

| Include | Exclude |
|---------|---------|
| Public types, interfaces, and contracts | Private/internal types |
| Configuration options and defaults | Implementation algorithms |
| Code examples showing typical usage | Source-code line-by-line walkthroughs |
| Error messages and troubleshooting | Performance internals (unless user-actionable) |
| Migration guidance and breaking changes | Historical design decisions |

**Indicators**: The reader is building an application on Mississippi.

### Internal Implementation

These pages answer: *How does this work?*

| Include | Exclude |
|---------|---------|
| Architectural diagrams and data flow | Step-by-step usage tutorials |
| Algorithm explanations and trade-offs | Configuration quickstarts |
| Performance characteristics and benchmarks | Basic "hello world" examples |
| Extension points and customization hooks | Public API reference tables |
| Design rationale and alternatives considered | Getting started guidance |

**Indicators**: The reader is contributing to Mississippi, debugging deep issues, or evaluating the framework's design.

## Example Overview Statements

### Public API Focus

> This page documents the `IBrookGrainFactory` interface and shows how to read and write events to brooks in your application.

### Internal Implementation Focus

> This page explains how the saga orchestration effect drives step execution and compensation internally. For usage guidance, see [Sagas](../event-sourcing/sagas/sagas.md).

## Core Principles

- **Single Audience**: One page, one reader profile.
- **Clear Purpose**: The overview tells the reader if they're in the right place.
- **Navigable Split**: Cross-links connect related pages with different focuses.
