# Allure Test Naming and Reporting

Governing thought: Apply a consistent Allure taxonomy so reports stay navigable and traceable.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Each test/class **MUST** set exactly one `[AllureParentSuite]`, `[AllureSuite]`, and `[AllureSubSuite]` (vertical slice → component → capability group).
- `[AllureEpic]` is optional; when used it **SHOULD** be single. `[AllureFeature]` and `[AllureStory]` **SHOULD** be single and only multi-valued when genuinely spanning items and documented.
- Names/IDs **MUST** be stable Title Case domain terms; no timestamps/guids/env/customer data. `[AllureId]` **MUST** be unique and stable.
- Use either xUnit `DisplayName` or `[AllureName]`, **MUST NOT** both; if `[AllureName]` is present it **MUST** align with the DisplayName meaning.
- Tags **MUST** follow `key:value` and **MUST NOT** duplicate suite/epic data. `[AllureOwner]` **MUST** be a team/alias (not an individual).
- Steps **MUST** use verb phrases in domain language; sensitive parameters **MUST** be masked/omitted.
- Tests spanning multiple bounded contexts **MUST** be split so each test covers one slice.

## Quick Start

- Set ParentSuite/Suite/SubSuite on the test class; add Epic/Feature/Story only when the team uses PM tooling.
- Choose Title Case names and stable IDs; pick either `DisplayName` or `[AllureName]`.
- Tag with controlled `key:value`; set `[AllureOwner]` to the team alias.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Required suite hierarchy present and accurate; optional backlog labels used correctly.
- [ ] Stable names/IDs with no runtime data; single naming surface (DisplayName or AllureName).
- [ ] Tags and owners follow conventions; steps are domain verb phrases with no sensitive data.
- [ ] Tests are scoped to one bounded context each.
