# Build Rules and Quality Standards

Governing thought: Every change ships only after warning-free builds, cleanup, tests, and (for Mississippi) mutation gates succeed.

## Rules (RFC 2119)

- Builds **MUST** be free of compiler/analyzer/StyleCop warnings; suppressions (`#pragma`, `[SuppressMessage]`, rule disables) **MUST NOT** be added without explicit approval and narrow scope.
- All changes **MUST** pass build, cleanup (ReSharper), unit tests, and mutation tests for Mississippi projects; mutation runs **MUST** be allowed to finish (plan for ~30 minutes). StyleCop violations **MUST** be fixed.
- Mississippi changes **MUST** include comprehensive tests; samples **SHOULD** include minimal illustrative tests.
- Package versions **MUST** remain centralized (CPM); do not add version attributes to project files.

## Quick Start

- Build → Clean → Fix until zero warnings:
  - `pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/build-mississippi-solution.ps1`
  - `pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/clean-up-mississippi-solution.ps1`
- Run tests and mutation (Mississippi):
  - `pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/unit-test-mississippi-solution.ps1`
  - `pwsh ./eng/src/agent-scripts/mutation-test-mississippi-solution.ps1`
- Final gate for both solutions: `pwsh ./go.ps1`.

## Scope and Audience

All contributors to Mississippi and Samples solutions.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] No warnings; no new suppressions without approval.
- [ ] Build/cleanup/tests/mutation scripts executed as appropriate; mutation not cancelled.
- [ ] Mississippi changes have full tests; sample changes have minimal examples.
- [ ] CPM honored; no package versions in project files.
