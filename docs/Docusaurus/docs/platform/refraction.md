# Refraction

Refraction is the planned component library designed to work with Mississippi’s framework and UX state model.

## Purpose

- Provide a curated set of UI components aligned to Reservoir and Inlet patterns.
- Encapsulate common UI state flows for Mississippi apps.

## Status

Refraction does not have an implementation in this branch yet. Source code links will be added once the component library exists.
