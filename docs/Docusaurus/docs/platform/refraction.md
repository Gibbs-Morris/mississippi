Refraction is the planned component library designed to work with Mississippi's
framework and UX state model.

## Purpose

Refraction will provide:

- **UI components** aligned to Reservoir and Inlet patterns
- **Common state flows** encapsulated as reusable components
- **Integration patterns** for Mississippi projections

## Status

Refraction is in planning. This page will be updated when implementation begins.

## Planned Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Projection-aware components | Auto-subscribe to projection updates |
| Loading states | Built-in loading/error handling for async data |
| Optimistic updates | UI patterns for command dispatch with rollback |
| Form integration | Reservoir-backed form state management |
