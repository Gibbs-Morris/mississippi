# Introduction

Welcome to the Mississippi documentation.

This is a minimal Docusaurus site set up for the Mississippi framework documentation.

## Getting Started

The documentation is organized into sections accessible through the sidebar.

This site supports versioning, which will be used to maintain documentation for different releases of the framework.
