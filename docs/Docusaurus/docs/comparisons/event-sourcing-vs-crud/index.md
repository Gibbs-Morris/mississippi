# Event Sourcing vs CRUD

> **TODO**: This page needs complete content.

**Summary**: Compares event-sourced systems and CRUD/3-tier architectures: CRUD stores only current state, while event sourcing records every change as immutable events. Notes the audit trail and concurrency benefits and the added complexity.

## Content To Be Added

- CRUD architecture overview
- Event sourcing fundamentals
- Key differences:
  - State storage: current vs history
  - Audit trail capabilities
  - Concurrency handling
  - Temporal queries
  - Complexity trade-offs
- When to choose each approach
- Migration considerations
