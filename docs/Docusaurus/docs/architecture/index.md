# Architecture Overview

> **TODO**: This page needs complete content.

**Summary**: Explains the high‑level design of Mississippi: how the framework layers map to domain modelling, distributed actors (Orleans grains), storage, messaging and workflow. Uses diagrams to show component interactions and flows.

## Content To Be Added

- Framework layers and responsibilities
- Component interaction diagrams (Mermaid)
- Data flow patterns
- Integration points with Orleans and Cosmos DB
