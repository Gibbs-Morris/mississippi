## EventSourcing.Cosmos TODO

This document captures the outstanding improvements and fixes to make the Cosmos provider production‑ready. Items are grouped by area, with rationale and clear acceptance criteria for future pickup.

### Concurrency: ETag support for head updates
- **Problem**: `head` updates use unconditional replace; no ETag precondition → races can overwrite head.
- **Scope**: `src/EventSourcing.Cosmos/Storage/CosmosRepository.cs`, `src/EventSourcing.Cosmos/Storage/HeadDocument.cs`, `src/EventSourcing.Cosmos/Storage/HeadStorageModel.cs`, `src/EventSourcing.Cosmos/Mapping/HeadDocumentToStorageMapper.cs`, appender paths.
- **Approach**:
  - Add ETag fields: add `string? ETag` to `HeadDocument` (map `_etag`) and to `HeadStorageModel`.
  - Map ETag in `HeadDocumentToStorageMapper`.
  - In `GetHeadDocumentAsync`, capture `response.ETag` and/or rely on `_etag` to populate `HeadStorageModel.ETag`.
  - In `ExecuteTransactionalBatchAsync`, use `TransactionalBatchItemRequestOptions { IfMatchEtag = currentHead.ETag }` when replacing `head`.
  - In `CommitHeadPositionAsync`, read current `head` and conditionally update using ETag as above.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Concurrent append attempts with diverging expected head fail with 412‑style behavior (surfaced as a clear exception).
  - Tests demonstrate ETag is round‑tripped and enforced.

### Pending head validation and recovery hardening
- **Problem**: `head-pending` is committed without verifying the `head` still equals `originalPosition`. Orphaned `head-pending` with existing `head` isn’t handled.
- **Scope**: `CosmosRepository.CommitHeadPositionAsync`, `CosmosRepository.CreatePendingHeadAsync`, `BrookRecoveryService`, `EventBrookAppender.AppendLargeBatchAsync`.
- **Approach**:
  - `CreatePendingHeadAsync`: before create, read `head`; if present and not equal to `currentHead`, abort with a specific concurrency error.
  - `CommitHeadPositionAsync`: read `head` (and `head-pending`) first; only commit if `head.Position == pending.originalPosition` using ETags on both update and delete.
  - Recovery: if `head` exists AND `head-pending` exists, verify range events; if none or incomplete, clean up stale pending; otherwise complete commit.
  - Large append: if `CreatePendingHeadAsync` returns 409 due to existing pending, invoke recovery flow (or fail with actionable message) instead of proceeding.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Stale `head-pending` never blocks writes permanently; recovery resolves it or surfaces a clear remediation error.
  - Commit refuses to advance when `head` diverged during long batch.

### Locking improvements (distributed blob leases)
- **What’s done**: Added jittered retries on 409 conflicts and improved renewal timestamping.
- **Remaining**:
  - Add configurable max acquire wait/backoff to avoid immediate failure under contention.
  - Replace broad catches in recovery with lock‑specific errors end‑to‑end (bubble a domain exception type from lock manager for clarity).
- **Acceptance**:
  - Under lock contention, writers backoff for a bounded time and either succeed or return a clear timeout error.

### Batch limits and request sizing safety
- **What’s done**: Translate 413 to clear error in batch executor.
- **Remaining**:
  - Pre‑check op count in `AppendEventBatchAsync` and `ExecuteTransactionalBatchAsync` (fail early if events would exceed 100 operations or configured `MaxEventsPerBatch`).
  - Add unit tests covering 100‑op and ~2MB request thresholds using `BatchSizeEstimator`.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Oversize requests fail fast with actionable errors; tests document this behavior.

### DI bootstrap: safe, async container initialization
- **Problem**: Service registration blocks synchronously and may delete containers with mismatched PK path.
- **What’s done**: Deletion replaced with fail‑fast error.
- **Remaining**:
  - Move Cosmos database/container provisioning to an async hosted initializer (`IHostedService` or `IStartupFilter`), no `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`.
  - Optionally provide a toggle (e.g., `BrookStorageOptions.AutoProvision`) to allow bootstrapping in dev only.
  - Use `ILogger` instead of `Console`.
- **Acceptance**:
  - No sync‑over‑async in DI; startup is async‑safe; no automatic destructive actions.

### Partition key consistency validation
- **Problem**: Writers use `BrookKey.ToString()` as partition key; readers use `brookRange.ToBrookCompositeKey().ToString()`.
- **Action**: Verify both produce identical strings for the same brook; if not, align the APIs and add tests.
- **Acceptance**: Unit test asserting PK identity for `BrookKey` and `BrookRangeKey.ToBrookCompositeKey()`.

### Mapper and data validation polish
- Add `ETag` support as above for head docs.
- Consider validating non‑empty `BrookEvent.Id` before mapping to storage to avoid accidental duplicate logical events (position id remains unique, but domain ID hygiene helps).
- **Acceptance**: Mapper round‑trips required fields; optional guardrails configurable via options.

### Recovery flow resilience and diagnostics
- Improve `BrookRecoveryService` logs to include brook id, positions, and decisions (commit vs rollback) via `ILogger`.
- Add retries around recovery operations (already using `IRetryPolicy` in places; ensure all calls are covered).
- **Acceptance**: Clear, structured logs and resilient recovery under transient errors.

### Tests to add
- ETag concurrency tests for single‑batch and large‑batch paths.
- Pending‑head stale recovery test (head present, pending present).
- Batch limit tests (count and size).
- Lock contention tests with simulated 409s.
- Partition key identity test.

### Nice‑to‑have
- Expose metrics around batch sizes, RU charges, retry attempts, and lock wait durations.
- Option to tune `LeaseDurationSeconds`/`LeaseRenewalThresholdSeconds` per workload.
